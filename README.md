# express-sqlite-vue-starter

Highly opinionated full stack starter template for quick prototyping. Useful for testing ideas.

It's actually a simple todo app with working user authentication. You can delete the `tasks` folder and start adding your own domain into the `/backend/services`.

Uses `Express` and `SQLite` for backend, `Vue 3` and `Tailwind CSS` for frontend.

If you want more "out-of-the-box" features, please open an issue and briefly describe the feature you have in your mind.
